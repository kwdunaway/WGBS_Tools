WGBS_Tools
=========
This is an older version and is no longer maintained. All of the relevant code has been transferred to Python.

WGBS_Tools is a versatile toolkit to manipulate and analyze Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing data. It is optimized for easy installation rather than efficiency. Any questions may be directed to Keith Dunaway (kwdunaway@ucdavis.edu) or Roy Chu (rgchu@ucdavis.edu).

####Example:

    perl adapter_split.pl input.fq output_noadap.fq output_withadap.fq

####Additional Info:

- The adapter sequence can be changed in the perl script and is stored in variable $fulladapter.
- This script can handle gzipped input ([gzip](http://www.gzip.org/)).

<a name="adapter_trimmer.pl">(2) adapter_trimmer.pl</a>

####Additional Info:

- Multiple percent methylation folders with sorted percent methylation bed files of each chromosome may be entered as inputs to be compared side by side.
- The user can set thresholds for each read. The minimum CpG site threshold will place an "NA" for the read for that experiment if the specified amount of CpG sites found in that read is not met. The minimum read threshold will ignore CpG sites with reads pertaining to that site lower than the specified threshold. The minimum file threshold is useful when multiple folders are input and requires percent methylation data (not "NA") for a read from at least the specified number of folders. If the file threshold is not met, the bed line is not printed to the output.

4. <a name="Pipelines"> Pipelines </a>
------------

#### Aligning WGBS ####
Example_WGBSalignment.bash is an example bash script that aligns and process whole genome bisulfite sequencing data using some of the tools listed above. The resulting files from this pipeline include:

1. Quality filtered reads.
2. Reads split into two files: those without adapter contamination and those with adapters trimmed out.
3. BAM and SAM of aligned reads
4. Percent Methylation files which is the processed data file most of the other scripts in this toolkit use.
5. Percent Methylation files with CpG Islands (CGI) masked out.

The intermediate files are usually kept until a dataset is fully analyzed. If you are short on disc space, delete everything but the unmasked Percent Methylation bed files. Almost everything else can be recreated easily from those file.

#### Window Analysis ####
Window_analysis.R finds significant window clusters with directionality of hypermethylated/hypomethylated. It takes output from Window_permeth_readcentric.pl, outputs data for window_cluster.pl, and takes the output from running window_cluster.pl.

1. Uses data from Window_permeth_readcentric.pl and performs multiple hypothesis testing
2. window_cluster.pl is run using the output file from this R script
3. The output of window_cluster.pl is then used in graphing the significant clusters back in this R script

#### DMR Analysis ####
DMR_analysis.R analyzes DMRs (usually on the order of 2kb large) using R packages bsseq and DSS. Gold standard DMRs pass permutation testing.

#### WGBS to 450k Comparison ####
WGBS_450k_Comparison.R is a template pipeline for analyzing data from AvgMeth.2col.pl and provides instructions on how to analyze HM450 probe locations with WGBS data. The script will require entry of experimental sample names, control sample names, file paths, and possibly edits to the graphs to fit your data. Much of the other processing is done. If you want to separate for hypermethylated/hypomethylated probe locations, separate your probe data accordingly and run this pipeline once for hypermethylated and once for hypomethylated.

##### Getting Started #####
###### STEP 1 ######
For this pipeline, your WGBS data must be in the format of percentage methylation bed files. These files will contain information in the format of "PercentageMethylation-TotalReadCount" (ex: 0.50-2). If your data is not in this format, check out the "Aligning WGBS" pipeline. 

###### STEP 2 ######
Run [AvgMeth.2col.pl](#AvgMeth.2col.pl). The output will give us a table for each CpG with 2 columns per sample, methylated read count and total read count. You will need to be in terminal and type:

    perl ./AvgMeth.2.col.pl

This will bring up a brief description of its inputs. To run the script, you will need to type the above command and each input in order afterwards, separated by a space. The inputs will be:
- [1] Your choice of the name and location of the output file
- [2] Bed file containing the probe locations you are interested in (Your 450k data)
- [3] The column number of the Illumina CpG identifier (ex: 3)
- [4] Minimum Read Threshold, which means at least x number of total reads to include this CpG (ex: 1)
- [5] Minimum File Threshold, which means at least x number of samples with sufficient data to include this CpG (ex: 1)
- [6] Prefix for sample, leaving out chr (Your WGBS Data)
- [7] Sample Name (Your WGBS Data)
- [8, 10, etc. Optional] If you have more than 1 sample, same as [6], Prefix for sample
- [9, 11, etc. Optional] If you have more than 1 sample, same as [7], Sample name

Explanation: Say your WGBS data has two samples:

    /home/user/John/PercentMethyl_Sample1/PercentMethyl_Sample1_chr1.bed
    /home/user/John/PercentMethyl_Sample1/PercentMethyl_Sample1_chr2.bed
    /home/user/John/PercentMethyl_Sample1/PercentMethyl_Sample1_chr3.bed
    ...
    /home/user/John/PercentMethyl_Sample2/PercentMethyl_Sample2_chr1.bed
    /home/user/John/PercentMethyl_Sample2/PercentMethyl_Sample2_chr2.bed
    /home/user/John/PercentMethyl_Sample2/PercentMethyl_Sample2_chr3.bed
    ...

An example input to the terminal would be:

    perl ./AvgMeth.2.col.pl output_table.txt HM450_hg38.bed 3 1 1 /home/user/John/PercentMethyl_Sample1/PercentMethyl_Sample1_ Sample1 /home/user/John/PercentMethyl_Sample2/PercentMethyl_Sample2_ Sample2

###### STEP 3 ######
It's time to look into the R script. First, edit these locations in the script:

Enter the names of your samples here (they need to be the same as what you entered above for AvgMeth.2col.pl)

Example: 

Exp_samples <- c("Sample1");

Ctl_samples <- c("Sample2");

Example with multiple samples:

Ctl_samples <- c("Sample1", "Sample2");

>Exp_samples <- c();

>Ctl_samples <- c();


If you want to upload from a file (same as above for AvgMeth.2col.pl)(make sure you are in the correct working directory)

Example:

WGBS_450k_filepath <- "output_table.txt"



>WGBS_450k_filepath <- ""

-OR-

If you want to work with your data frame first and then enter it

change WGBS_450k_file <- read.delim(WGBS_450k_filepath) 

to WGBS_450k_file <- YourDataFrame


###### STEP 4 ######

Now, go step-by-step running each command of the R script to ensure that the following commands will have the correct previous data. There are sample graphs and data manipulations created by the R script. You may edit or add your own or use the script however you need.
